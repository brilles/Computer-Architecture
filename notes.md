LS-8 computer:

- 8-bit computer with 8-bit memory addressing
- With 8 bits the CPU has a total of 256 bytes of memory and can compute values up to 255

0b1101 == 13 decimal (base 10)

8 + 4 + 1 == 13

0b10101011 == ??

128 + 32 + 8 + 2 + 1 == 171

16 + 1 == 17

0b10000 + 0b1 = 0b10001

Take advantage of alignments - every four bits represents 1 hex digit
Ob1111 == 15
0x == hex
0xF == 15

101000100
0b 1010 00100
0x A 4 hex

0x C 8
0b 1100 1000
0xC8 == 0b11001000

0b1111 15 (one less than 16)
0b10000 16
0b11111111 == 255 (1 less than 256)
0x 1111 1111

ip4v are bytes

registers are like variables that are built into the CPU
fixed number and they can only hold so much(physical contraint of CPU wires)
